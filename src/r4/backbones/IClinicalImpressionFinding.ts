/**
 * @name IClinicalImpressionFinding
 * @description A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies that are best to manage a patient\u0027s condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending on the clinical workflow. This resource is called \"ClinicalImpression\" rather than \"ClinicalAssessment\" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools such as Apgar score.
